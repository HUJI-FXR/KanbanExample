# KanbanExample
An example of a kanban

Go to Projects on the top bar, and choose the Group kanban.

You may create this kind of kanban yourself, and should use it in the project.

There are 4 Columns; 
Todo are ideas that will be worked on in the future
In progress are ideas that are worked on being implemented currently
Done are the ideas that were fully implemented, meaning they have passed past columns successfully.
The fourth is an example of an addition of a new row, that you may add by pressing on the "+" button to the right.

There are things you may connect to each item:

Assignees - the users that will / are working on the item.
Status - the column it is on
Priority - P0 / P1 / P2 where P0 is the highest priority and P2 is the lowest. Priority moves it up the column accordingly.

The other three are self explanatory, you may use them if you feel like it is needed.

On top of all that, you may create an Issue:
